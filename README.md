> Since there was some unnecessary drama regarding the so-called `RogueEditor`, I decided not to use it anymore and to create two projects, one for the JS Hacks / Tools and one for modifying and saving accounts and game saves. I will recreate the same functionality using only the official source code and no other project to avoid drama, I just want to create new tools and features.
